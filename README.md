# ZZZ Autopatch Download Links
Official Zenless Zone Zero Download Links

All links come straight from official HoYoverse "Autopatch" servers; The links are what the HoYoplay launcher and game connect to to download the game and any pre-loads / diffs. 

I will be focussing on the Global releases "autopatchos", rather than the Chinese "autopatchcn" links, as they are far easier to find and/or grab.

# Link Status
## Pre-Release
Pre-release consists of Version 0.13 (Tuning Test), 0.2.0 (Equalizing Test), and 0.3.0 (Amplifying Test). 
Unfortunately, all the links I have for pre-release are dead and 404 on connect.

## Post-Launch
Links mostly come from Reddit and other sites, as I have yet to find the correct API to hook into for ZZZ, unlike Genshin.
