# ZZZ Autopatch Download Links
Official Zenless Zone Zero Download Links

All links come straight from official HoYoverse "Autopatch" servers; The links are what the HoYoplay launcher and game connect to to download the game and any pre-loads / diffs. 

I will be focussing on the Global releases "autopatchos", rather than the Chinese "autopatchcn" links, as they are far easier to find and/or grab.

# Link Status
## Pre-Release
Pre-release consists of Version 0.13 (Tuning Test), 0.2.0 (Equalizing Test), and 0.3.0 (Amplifying Test). 
Unfortunately, all the links I have for pre-release are dead and 404 on connect.

## Release
Links mostly come from Reddit and other sites. 1.7+ taken from [HoYo's official API](https://sg-hyp-api.hoyoverse.com/hyp/hyp-connect/api/getGamePackages?game_ids%5B%5D=U5hbdsT9W7&launcher_id=VYTpXlbWo8)
